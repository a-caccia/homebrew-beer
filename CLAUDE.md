# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Structure
- This is a home brewing repository for beer recipes, specifically Belgian Tripel
- Key files: Belgian_Tripel_Brew_Log.csv (timeline), checklist.md (brewing steps), misurazioni.xlsx (measurements)

## Guidelines
- When modifying brewing recipes, always preserve original measurements
- For checklist.md, maintain Markdown formatting with proper headers and checkboxes
- When updating brew log data, maintain CSV format with consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- All measurements should include units (g, L, °C, SG) and be appropriate for brewing context
- Fermentation temperatures should always be kept between 18-23°C unless specified otherwise
- Prefer metric units over imperial units
- When calculating amounts, show formulas (e.g., "7g/L × 18L = 126g")

## Conventions
- Use proper brewing terminology (OG, FG, SG for gravity measurements)
- Keep all notes concise and actionable
- Preserve checklist format with clear step numbering
- Always maintain data in existing formats and structures
